took a stab at getting a log analyzer out there, then Sitecore released one, so I tried to make mine better.

this log analyzer runs in Sitecore and the main benefit is it's connection to a centralized repository of comments about each type of error and warning.  This functionality includes upvoting and downvoting comments.

things I'd love to add to this:
- the project started as MVC before moving to normal webapp, and the coding was done in a couple all nighters separated by months, so some refactoring is in order
- need the ability to delete a comment or flag for delete
- need pagination on the listing pages
- could use a real modal for inputting comments
- would like to redo the UI to make it look more like it belongs in Sitecore
- all log parsing is done haphazardly in memory, moving to a temp DB would enable parsing of larger logs
- need ability to scan full log folder (and drop the restriction for only 24 hours of graph)
- anything you can think of


NOTE: this project can be run standalone, but to install it in Sitecore just install the latest package under /Packages/ and update the binary as you build
